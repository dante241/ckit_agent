//! Single source of truth for the CLI's identity. Edit the two literals below
//! (or set `SC_CMD` / `SC_NS` at build time) to rebrand the whole CLI in one
//! place — the invoked command name, help text, on-disk config/cache namespace,
//! AGENTS.md sentinels, and deployed-artifact filenames all follow from here.
//!
//! Default `CMD == NS == "8sync"` ⇒ every derived string is identical to the
//! historical hardcoding, so the default build + deploy are byte-for-byte
//! unchanged (safe cutover). The upstream identity `8-Sync-Dev` and the
//! `github.com` / `raw.githubusercontent.com` self-update URLs are NEVER
//! rebranded (renaming them would break `up`/install) — and since the literal
//! lowercase token `8sync` never appears inside `8-Sync-Dev` or those URLs,
//! `render` leaves them untouched automatically.
